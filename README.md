### A Sudoku Solver using Backtracking
This project is a simple implementation of a backtracking algorithm used to
solve a sudoku. The project consist of 4 parts:

1. Generating a Sudoku Grid with difficulty level
2. Solving the Sudoku using the Backtracking algorithm
3. Visualize the Backtracking algorithm
4. User input

### Part 1: Generating a Sudoku Grid with difficulty level

  Step 1: Generating a Sudoku with Unique Solution
	1. Find an existing sudoku
	2. Exchange the values with a random group
	3. Exchange the cell or the column or the row-grid or the colum-grid

  Step 2: Deleting Cells based on difficulty level
	1. Ask the user for difficulty level
	2. Initialize the right number of cells to remove
	3. Remove the cells

  More: Generating sudoku with more than one solution

### Part 2: Solving the Sudoku using the Backtracking algorithm

### Part 3: Visualize the Backtracking algorithm
  
  Step 1: Print the step
	1. Clear the screen
	2. Print the grid
	3. Make system sleep

### Part 4: User Input
